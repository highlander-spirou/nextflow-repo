# Nextflow project

This project aim to learn and develop a nextflow workflow that intergrated on the cloud, with high industrial standard.

The skeleton of this nextflow project is based on the nextflow training repo: https://training.nextflow.io/basic_training/rnaseq_pipeline/

This repo contains the fourth part: **Run nextflow to AWS EC2, with native S3 access**

This part reuse the second part, with a sole difference is the removal of access key, since we directly access the role from the AWS IAM service
